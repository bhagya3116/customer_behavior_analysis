📘 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from loading a dataset in Python to performing EDA, cleaning data, running SQL queries in MySQL, building a Power BI dashboard, and creating a final analytical report. The goal is to extract insights, identify trends, and present results in a clear and actionable format.

📂 Dataset

Contains customer-related records 

Loaded into Python for preprocessing and exploratory analysis.

Cleaned and transformed before being used for SQL queries and Power BI dashboards.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas)

Jupyter Notebook

MySQL (SQL queries and database operations)

Power BI (Dashboard creation)

GitHub (Project hosting and version control)

🔎 Steps & Workflow

1️⃣ Load Dataset in Python

Import dataset using Pandas.

Inspect data types, structure, and missing values.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Correlation analysis

Distribution plots and trend identification

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handle missing and duplicate values

Fix inconsistent data types

Format columns for SQL and BI compatibility

4️⃣ SQL Analysis in MySQL

Import cleaned data into MySQL

Run queries for:

Customer segmentation

Category-level insights

Purchase summaries and KPIs

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Data modeling and relationship setup

Visualizations (KPIs, charts, segment breakdowns)

Interactive filters for deeper insights

6️⃣ Report Creation

Summary of insights from SQL + EDA + Dashboard

Key findings and business recommendations

📊 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights key metrics, customer trends, and business insights using interactive visuals. It provides a clear view of performance across categories, demographics, and time periods.

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run EDA & cleaning steps

Load cleaned data into MySQL

Execute SQL queries from the SQL folder

Open the Power BI file (.pbix) to view the dashboard

✅ Result

This project delivers a full end-to-end analysis pipeline, transforming raw data into meaningful insights supported by SQL analytics and an interactive Power BI dashboard.
